## Introduction

Using the National Park Services API, I created a site that can search for Parks by State.

Created using Html, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.

### Features

Choose from one or more States to search. The information from your search will include, name, description about the park, and a website for more information on the park itself.



I hope you find some great parks to explore!
